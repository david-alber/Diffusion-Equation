# Diffusion-Equation
In this Project we are trying to solve the heat diffusion equation of the form: 

 $$\alpha$$

  $\frac{\delta \phi}{\delta t} = \frack{\delta}{\delta x}\left(k(\phi)\frac{\delta}{\delta x}\phi\right)$
 
 Our approach is to use a combination of **finite elements** (B-Splines) to approximate the derivative in space and **explicit Euler** to approximate the evolution in time.

## Two Folders:
* 1) Descriptive \.ipynb files. To give a descriptive overview  of the problem and show intermediate results via Jupyter sessions
* 2) \.py files containing code to comment, modify and work on
